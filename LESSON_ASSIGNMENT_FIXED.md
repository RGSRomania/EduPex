# ✅ Fixed: Lesson Content Now Properly Assigned

## What Was Fixed

The issue where clicking on Mathematics was showing Romanian language questions has been **RESOLVED**.

### The Problem
- All 108 lessons were getting Romanian content, even the Math lessons
- This happened because the sync script didn't properly detect which lessons should get which subject

### The Solution  
- ✅ Applied **54 Math lessons** with correct Mathematics content
- ✅ Applied **54 Romanian lessons** with correct Romanian language content
- Lessons now properly separated by subject

## Next Step: Clear Cache

Your browser still has the old content cached. You need to clear it:

### On macOS:
```
Cmd + Shift + Delete  (to open clear cache dialog)
Select "All time"
Click "Clear data"
Then press: Cmd + Shift + R  (hard refresh)
```

### On Windows:
```
Ctrl + Shift + Delete (to open clear cache dialog)  
Select "All time"
Click "Clear data"
Then press: Ctrl + F5  (hard refresh)
```

## What You'll See After Clearing Cache

When you click on **Matematica**, you'll now see:
- ✅ "Numere naturale și operații fundamentale" (math content)
- ✅ Quiz question about mathematics
- ✅ Not Romanian language content

When you click on **Limba Română**, you'll see:
- ✅ "Comunicare și limba - procesul comunicării" (Romanian content)
- ✅ Quiz questions about language
- ✅ Not mathematics content

## Verification

All 108 lessons have been properly assigned:
- Math L1-L8: Numbers, Operations, Fractions, Decimals, Measurements
- Romanian L1-L8: Communication, Sounds, Words, Nouns, Adjectives, Verbs, Sentences, Texts
- Plus additional lessons from extended curriculum
