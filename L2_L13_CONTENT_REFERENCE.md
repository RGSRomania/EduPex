- Perfect cubes: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216...

**Examples:**
- 2³ = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8
- 5² = 5 × 5 = 25
- 3² = 9 (perfect square)

### L9: Reguli de calcul cu puteri

**Key Concepts:**
- Multiplication of powers: a^m × a^n = a^(m+n)
- Division of powers: a^m ÷ a^n = a^(m-n)
- Power of a power: (a^m)^n = a^(m×n)
- Power of a product: (a × b)^n = a^n × b^n
- Power of a quotient: (a ÷ b)^n = a^n ÷ b^n

**Examples:**
- 3² × 3³ = 3⁵ = 243
- 5⁴ ÷ 5² = 5² = 25
- (2²)³ = 2⁶ = 64
- (2 × 5)² = 4 × 25 = 100

- 2 is prime and even
- 9 is composite (3 × 3)

### L12: Descompunerea în factori primi

**Key Concepts:**
- Prime factorization (unique for each composite number)
- Method: Divide by smallest prime factors successively
- Exponential notation: 12 = 2² × 3
- GCD (Greatest Common Divisor): Use common factors with lowest powers
- LCM (Least Common Multiple): Use all factors with highest powers

**Examples:**
- 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 = 2² × 3
- 30 = 2 × 3 × 5
- 100 = 2² × 5²
- GCD(12, 18) = 6 (2 × 3)
- LCM(12, 18) = 36 (2² × 3²)

### L13: Ecuații în N

**Key Concepts:**
- Equation: Equality with unknowns
- Types and solutions:
  - a + x = b → x = b - a (if b ≥ a)
  - x - a = b → x = a + b
  - a × x = b → x = b ÷ a (if a | b)
  - x ÷ a = b → x = a × b
- In N, solution must be a natural number
- Always verify solution by substitution

**Examples:**
- x + 5 = 12 → x = 12 - 5 = 7
- x - 3 = 10 → x = 10 + 3 = 13
- 3 × x = 15 → x = 15 ÷ 3 = 5
- x ÷ 4 = 6 → x = 4 × 6 = 24
- 2x + 1 = 9 → 2x = 8 → x = 4
